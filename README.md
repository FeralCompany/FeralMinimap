## Brief Feature Overview

A replacement for [LethalCompanyMinimap][Minimap] that is intended to be more user-friendly and better integrated with the game and other mods.

1. No longer hijacks the ship monitor. No need to "unlock" your minimap before teleporting players.
2. Integration with [InputUtils][InputUtils] for button handling.
3. Integration with [LethalConfig][LethalConfig] for configuration.
4. View text indicates if you're viewing a Radar Booster or another player.
